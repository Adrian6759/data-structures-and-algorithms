### Challenge 10

# Stacks and Queues
This code challenge has a few functions for stacks and queues classes. It has a push, pop, peek, isEmpty for stacks and enqueue, dequeue, peek, and isEmpty for queues.

## Challenge
We have to implement all the methods and give them the ability to pass the following tests. Can successfully push onto a stack
Can successfully push multiple values onto a stack
Can successfully pop off the stack
Can successfully empty a stack after multiple pops
Can successfully peek the next item on the stack
Can successfully instantiate an empty stack
Calling pop or peek on empty stack raises exception
Can successfully enqueue into a queue
Can successfully enqueue multiple values into a queue
Can successfully dequeue out of a queue the expected value
Can successfully peek into a queue, seeing the expected value
Can successfully empty a queue after multiple dequeues
Can successfully instantiate an empty queue
Calling dequeue or peek on empty queue raises exception.

## Approach & Efficiency

We were trying to implement these with the least amount of code.

## API

Push-Adds a value to the Stack
Pop-Removes the top from the Stack
Peek-Returns the value of the top
IsEmpty-Returns true if Stack is empty
Enqueue-Adds a value to the back of the queue
Dequeue-Removes a value from the front of a queue

## Collaboration
Collaborated with Sharmarke and Ryan. Had help from Raul and Tammy. Used Stacks and Queues Read Assignment Reference for guidance.
