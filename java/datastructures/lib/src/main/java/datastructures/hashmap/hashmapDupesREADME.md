# Hashmap Repeated Word

## Problem Domain

Arguments: string
Return: string


## Whiteboard Process

![Linked List Insertions](./HashmapRepeatWord.png)

## Approach & Efficiency
Attempted to split string into a grouping of strings so that we could target individual words. We would then increment every time we come across a word.

## Collaboration
Worked with Sharmarke, Ryan, and Devon
